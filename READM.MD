# Blood Glucose Tracker

## Description

This is a simple web-based blood glucose tracking application designed to help users log and view their blood sugar levels. It provides a clean interface for adding new entries and displaying a history of records. The project is built to practice DOM manipulation and working with external APIs using a deployed `json-server`.

## Project Overview

The application interacts with a live backend (hosted on Render) and is fully functional online. Users can access the application directly to add, view, and delete blood glucose records.

### Features

* View a list of blood glucose records
* Add new records (date, time, and level)
* Delete existing records

## Live Demo

You can view and use the live application here:

> The app communicates with a deployed JSON server hosted on Render, so it works fully online â€” no installation required.
